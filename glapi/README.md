## What It Is ##
GreenLightning is a Java 8 functional API for embedded systems that's built on a small footprint, garbage free compact 1 Java web server and message routing platform, 

GreenLightning is...
- Fast - Built on top of GreenLightning, FogLight is a garbage-free, lock-free and low latency way to talk directly to hardware.
- Simple - Taking advantage of the latest Java 8 APIs, GreenLightning has a clean and fluent set of APIs that make it easy to learn and apply with minimal training.
- Secure - By taking advantage of the compile-time graph validation system, all GreenLightning applications can be compiled and compressed to a point where injecting malicious code into the final production JAR would prove difficult, if not impossible.

# GreenLightning
Fast small footprint HTTP server in Java


When running tests with a small 30 byte file I was able to to hit the following numbers
for unencrypted http calls on a 4 core box.  

The test makes 16K simultaneous (in flight) requests of 32 connections. Many more permutations are left to still be tested.

Green Lightning:   1,000K RPS (saturated 1Gb connection)  (in large mode)

Green Lightning:   500K RPS (in small mode mode between 60-160MB of memory)

NGINX:             260K RPS

Netty:             160K RPS


The build server:
https://pronghorn.ci.cloudbees.com/job/GreenLightning/

The code on GitHub:
https://github.com/oci-pronghorn/GreenLightning

To build a jar just run `mvn install` then run the `go.sh`
shell file to start up the demo web page
review `go.sh` to see how it is called.

To build and run a native binary:

 1. Download and install [Excelsior JET](https://www.excelsiorjet.com)
    (the 90-day trial will work just fine).
 2. Do one of the following:
      * Add the Excelsior JET `bin/` directory to `PATH` and run `mvn jet:build`.
      * Run `mvn jet:build -Djet.home=`*JET-Home*
 3. Run `go-native.sh`.

The zip file in `target/jet` can be copied to other systems.

## Options

--t is for turning on or off TLS (https) support, keys are built in cant change yet

--s is the folder holding the static site pages,  these can not be changed while its running
     note if this points to the index.html file it will be used as the default for the domain. 
     
--l is for running in large mode where it allocates many GB for performance
    with -l False  (the small mode) it is still much more performant than any other 
    server I could find.
    
--h what host to run this on (eg ip) if not provided it will guess from network settings.

--p what port to run on the default is 8080 even when TLS is turned on.


When running small mode on a compact 1 JVM the app will only use about 60MB.
When running small mode on a normal JVM the app will use about 160MB.
